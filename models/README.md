# Instructions

1. The path to the simulated data file has to be given in line 2 of cell 4 in ANN_k_fold_CV.ipynb and in line 2 of cell 2 in RF_regressos_k_fold_CV.ipynb
2. The index file is used to shuffle the data in the same way in the both models. The path to the index file has to be given in line 2 of cell 12 in ANN_k_fold_CV.ipynb and in line 1 of cell 9 in RF_regressos_k_fold_CV.ipynb
3. THe python libraries used for the models are:- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, pytorch, csv, pickle, time
