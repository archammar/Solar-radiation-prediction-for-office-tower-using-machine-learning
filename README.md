# Solar-radiation-prediction-for-office-tower-using-machine-learning


This repository contains the grass-hopper files for testing new scenarios and jupyter-notebooks for the prediction tasks. The machine learning models used are artificial neural network and decision tree.


## Instructions
1. The data folder contains the simulation data used to build the machine learning models.
2. The grasshopper folder contains Rhino file corresponding to the new scenarios and grasshopper file for making the solar radiation predictions using decision tree surrogate model.
3. The pretrained models folder contain the pretrained ML codes in jupyter-notebooks for making the predictions of new cases.
