# Solar-radiation-prediction-for-office-tower-using-machine-learning


This repository contains the grass-hopper files for testing new scenarios and jupyter-notebooks for the prediction tasks. The machine learning models used are artificial neural network and random forest.


## Instructions
1. The data folder contains the simulation data used to build the machine learning models.
2. The pretrained models are stored in the folder ML models.
